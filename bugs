1. Not all the video player area is touchable which is bad experience
    Should be fixed
2. You almost cannot use the bottom time slider to move forward and back
    Should be fixed
3. I want to add +5 and +30 move forward and back like in Pixellot app
    TODO
4. Switching from portrait to landscape doesn’t open the video player on full screen automatically as in any other app
    This is not WebSDK reponsibility
5. Clicking on the bottom right side of the screen stops the video
    Can not reproduce
6. After cutting one clip the cutting clip button disappears
    No, it does not
7. When starting to cut clip after few seconds the stop recording button disappears – we have to leave it visible
    Fixed
8. When clicking on the screen to see it again it automatically stops the recording which is wrong, even without clicking on the stop recording
    Fixed
9. There is no indication that the clip is in progress
    Not WebSDk
10. There is no indication that the clip is ready
    Not WebSDK
